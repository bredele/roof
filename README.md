# roof

HTML implementation fully compatible with [brick](http://github.com/bredele/brick) and [grout](http://github.com/bredele/grout).


## API

It is a partial implementation of DOM and doesn't follow any standards. It is just enough to get [brick](http://github.com/bredele/brick), [grout](http://github.com/bredele/grout) and their plugins working on node. 

However any pull request is welcome to make of roof a fast an accurate DOM implementation.
